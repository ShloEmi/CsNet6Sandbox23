    Write a C# program that uses a Monitor object to implement a simple producer-consumer scenario. 
    The program should use a thread-safe queue to hold the data, 
     with one thread adding items to the queue (the producer) and another thread removing items from the queue (the consumer). 
    The producer should wait when the queue is full, and the consumer should wait when the queue is empty. 
    Use the Monitor object to ensure that only one thread accesses the queue at a time.
